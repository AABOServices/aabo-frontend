# Quick Start Guide - Get Your Portfolio Running! 🚀

## ⚡ 3 Steps to See Your App Running

### Step 1: Install Dependencies (2 minutes)

Open your terminal in the project directory and run:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all required packages:
- React & React DOM
- React Router
- Redux Toolkit
- Axios
- Vite

### Step 2: Start the Development Server (5 seconds)

```bash
npm run dev
```

You should see:
```
  VITE v5.x.x  ready in xxx ms

  ➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
  ➜  Network: use --host to expose
```

### Step 3: Open Your Browser

Navigate to **http://localhost:5173/**

## 🎉 What You'll See

### Your Portfolio Page with:
- ✅ **3 sample projects** displayed in a beautiful grid layout
- ✅ **Search bar** to find projects
- ✅ **Filter dropdowns** for status and type
- ✅ **Project cards** showing:
  - Project name and code
  - Status badge (color-coded)
  - Client name
  - Project type
  - Date range
  - Progress bar (%)
  - Budget tracking
  - Team size

### Try These Actions:
1. **Search**: Type "Refinería" in the search box
2. **Filter by Status**: Select "Activo" from the status dropdown
3. **Filter by Type**: Choose "REFINERY" from type dropdown
4. **Click a Project**: Click any card to navigate (you'll see a placeholder for now)
5. **Clear Filters**: Click "Limpiar filtros" button

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Cannot find module..."
**Solution**: Run `npm install` again

### Issue: Port 5173 is already in use
**Solution**: 
- Close other Vite instances
- Or edit `vite.config.js` to use a different port

### Issue: "React is not defined"
**Solution**: Make sure you ran `npm install` and all files are saved

### Issue: Blank white screen
**Solution**: 
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Check for error messages
3. Make sure all files are saved
4. Try refreshing the page (Ctrl/Cmd + R)

### Issue: Mock data not loading
**Solution**: Check `.env.development` has `VITE_USE_MOCKS=true`

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Mock Data
All data comes from `src/services/mocks/projectMocks.js`. You can:
- Add more projects
- Modify existing projects
- Change budgets, dates, progress

### Styling
Want to change colors? Edit `src/styles/variables.css`:
```css
:root {
  --color-primary: #2563eb;  /* Change this! */
  --color-success: #10b981;  /* And this! */
}
```

### Adding Projects
Want to see more projects? Edit `src/services/mocks/projectMocks.js`:
```javascript
export const mockProjects = [
  // ... existing projects
  {
    id: 'PROJ-004',
    name: 'Your New Project',
    code: 'YNP-2024',
    // ... more fields
  },
];
```
